Two-way binding is a programming concept where two or more components are connected in such a way that changes to one component are automatically reflected in the other component(s), and vice versa.

In other words, when the state of one component changes, the state of the other component(s) is updated automatically, and when the state of the other component(s) changes, the state of the first component is updated automatically.

This creates a bidirectional flow of data between the components, hence the name "two-way binding".

Two-way binding is commonly used in:

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectures, where the view and view model are bound together.
Data binding in user interfaces, where the UI elements are bound to the underlying data model.
Angular and other JavaScript frameworks, where two-way binding is used to synchronize data between the view and the model.

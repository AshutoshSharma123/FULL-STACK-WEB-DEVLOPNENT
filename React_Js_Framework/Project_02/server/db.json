      "description": "Apple Watch is a brand of smartwatch products developed and marketed by Apple Inc., first released on April 24, 2015.\n It integrates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, operating with watchOS and other Apple products and services.\n As of September 2025, new Apple Watches come with watchOS 26 preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS 26, which is compatible with the iPhone 11 or later.\n The device is designed to work in conjunction with a paired iPhone for configuration and data syncing, but can also connect to Wi-Fi for data-reliant tasks, including communications and audio streaming.\n LTE-equipped models can perform these functions over a mobile network and make and receive phone calls independently when the iPhone is not nearby or powered off."
